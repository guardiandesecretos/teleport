{"name":"Flex","tagline":"A Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange","body":"### Welcome to Flex, a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies and fiat money.\r\n\r\nFlex allows you to trade cryptocurrencies without the need\r\nfor a centralized exchange. It does this by breaking secrets\r\ninto many parts and distributing these parts to a large\r\nnumber of miners, who are unlikely to all be colluding.\r\n\r\nTransmit Cryptocurrencies in Seconds\r\n------------------------------------\r\nYou can request a deposit address for a specific cryptocurrency.\r\nNobody knows the private key to the deposit address, but many\r\nminers each know a part. If you deposit funds to that address,\r\nno one entity will be able to reconstruct the key needed to\r\nspend them.\r\n\r\nYou can then request that they send you the parts of the private key,\r\nand have the funds back in your wallet in seconds, or you could\r\ntransfer the deposit (i.e. give the right to withdraw the secret\r\nparts or to transfer again) to another Flex address in seconds. \r\n\r\nThere are no fees other than the fees for sending the cryptocurrencies\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFree Software\r\n-------------\r\nThe Flex software is available under the terms of the AGPLv3.\r\n\r\nInterested in the Details?\r\n--------------------------\r\nCheck out the [Flex Protocol](files/protocol.pdf), or take a look at the [source](https://github.com/peer-node/flex).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
